# comradescript
a coding language based on communism, 70% of ideas generated by chatgpt

ignore second branch, idk how to use github

## needed npm installs
- mz
- dotenv
- moo
- nearley
- fs

maybe some others


## using
go to the .env and only change file name and file path

## running
cd to the place you installed comradescript (place with package.json) and run the command
```
npm run build
```
this generates an ast in the form of a json and a c++ file, the c++ code is what the .crsc should be.

vscode has an extension called NPM-scripts that shows the npm scripts in the folder you've opened, ctrl-k + ctrl-o to open the folder.

## documentation
- you need a main function
- semicolons
- comments use //
- WE (team of one person) didn't forget about inputs, WE couldn't get it working

### variable declaration
variables cannot be local (can't be declared in functions and ifs and stuff) because that would be private ownership of a variable
```
shared TYPE NAME = VALUE;
```

here are the valid types
- people_count    (int)
- resource_share  (float)
- propaganda      (string)
- party_loyalty   (boolean)

### print
```
broadcast MESSAGE to all comrades;
```

### default functions
- collective_strength   (abs)
- wave_of_change        (sin)
- solidarity_wave       (cos)
- revolutionary_angle   (tan)
- root_of_progress      (sqrt)
- people_power          (pow)
- collective_growth     (log)
- ground_level          (floor)
- higher_aim            (ceil)

### if statements
```
consensus_if BOOL {
    CODE HERE
}
```

### repeat
```
factory TIMES link POINTERNAME {
    CODE HERE
}
```
idea by chatgpt

### while
```
proletariat_rally BOOL {
    CODE HERE
}
```

### for
```
assemble DECLARATION workers to produce WHILE items called i with process STATEMENT {
    CODE HERE
}
```

### function declaration
```
TYPE FUNCTIONAME $ {
    CODE HERE
}
```

here are the valid types
- people_count    (int)
- resource_share  (float)
- propaganda      (string)
- party_loyalty   (boolean)
- comrade_duty    (void)

you cannot use arguments because those would mean local variables and that's not good, private ownership of variables is bad.

main function:
```
comrade_duty main $ {
    CODE HERE
}
```

returns are just a regular ```return VALUE;```
